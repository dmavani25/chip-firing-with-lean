    Proving this directly requires formalizing Dhar's burning algorithm or deeper results
    relating q-reduced divisors to acyclic orientations, which is beyond the current scope.
    Attempts to prove it here encounter difficulties due to interactions
    between `config_degree` and the value at `q`, or potential definition mismatches.
    Therefore, it remains an axiom for now. -/
