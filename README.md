# Chip-Firing with Lean4

A formalization of chip-firing games and the Riemann-Roch theorem for graphs using the Lean 4 theorem prover.

## Overview

This project provides a formal mathematical framework for studying **chip-firing games on graphs** and proves key results, including the **Riemann-Roch theorem for graphs**. The implementation leverages Lean 4 for formal proofs and structured reasoning.

The codebase is modular, with the following key components:

- **`Basic`**: Core definitions and utilities for `CFGraph` and structures related to divisors.
- **`CFGraphExample`**: Example graphs and chip-firing scenarios to verify functionality.
- **`Config`**: Definitions and operations involving configurations on `CFGraph`s.
- **`Orientation`**: Definitions and utilities for orientations on `CFGraph`s.
- **`Rank`**: Rank functions and related structures for divisors.
- **`Helpers`**: Auxiliary lemmas, theorems, and propositions supporting other modules.
- **`RRGHelpers`**: Specific lemmas and results used in proving the **Riemann-Roch theorem**.
- **`RiemannRochForGraphs`**: The **main** formalization of the Riemann-Roch theorem for graphs.

## Requirements

To run and explore the project, you will need the following:

- **Lean 4**
- **Lake**: Lean 4's build tool
- Required dependencies (managed via `lakefile.lean`):
  - [mathlib4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4): Core mathematical library for Lean 4
  - **Paperproof**: (Optional) proof visualization tool
